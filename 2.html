        <h1>My Education</h1>
        <p>I received my schooling at St. Peter's School in Bharatpur. After that, I enrolled at Vibrant Academy Kota,
            where I completed my 11th and 12th grades and studied for the JEE. In my first attempt, I received a rank of
            6891. (thanks to homesickness). After that, I dropped at Allen for a year and eventually got 223 CRL and
            admission to IITK for computer science. I may not appear conventional at first since I have
            an other perspective on life I see it as a chance to learn about the cosmos rather than squandering it in
            dread. Most of the time, I may be lost in my own world, appreciating nature's beauty. </p>
